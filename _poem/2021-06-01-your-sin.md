title: Your Sin
---

Body of milk and roses,  
secure me in all your poses,  

the night is long, and I don't see an end,  
I see you dancing and around you the light bends,

let my body, my sufferings dig into you,  
there are many who pass by the meadows, but those who fall and trip are just a few,

the stars are falling, the ships are sinking,  
I am all drenched and my body is stinking,

of love that I hold within,  
it's okay if I am not enough, just let me be one of your sins.
