                    <p>Living in a house with a private balcony has always been my dream. Note the word <em>private</em>, I prefer not to share a balcony just like I prefer not to share my <em>books</em>.</p>
                    <p>The houses we had been living in till I graduated from high school were without a balcony, we weren’t able to find a house with one, so the university hostels were my only escape then. To my bad luck, my family shifted to a new house with a balcony a few months after I entered university. Though I was happy to stretch my arms on a balcony, even if for a few days when I went home during the holidays.</p>
                    <p>Apparently, hostel rooms for the first-year students didn’t have a balcony, so I made peace with the thought that I will have one in my second year of university. The hostel room in my second year did have a balcony, but it received no sunlight throughout the year. A balcony without sunlight for me is no balcony at all. So I patiently waited for the third year of college, every year was hope for me because every year we had the chance to shift to a new room.</p>
                    <p>My room in the third year of university had a balcony that received sunlight for a few hours,  but it was shared. Phew! A shared balcony with sunlight; half of my dream was fulfilled. However, I was okay, I had one more year left of college, final year rooms were not shared and all of them had a balcony. Yay!</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, all these years I used to sit in the hostel verandah and look up at the sun with eyes closed to feel the warmth, something we secretly crave for all our lives.</p>
                    <p>The balcony in my room in the final year of university was all mine with sunlight, but it didn’t have a view, it faced the hostel courtyard where I could just see security guards for most of the day! Three-quarters of my dream were fulfilled. Not so bad!</p>
                    <p>A private balcony facing the street where I could sip coffee whilst reading a book, feel the gentleness of the breeze and protection of the sunlight, see life passing by on the streets in haste while I sit to savour it and enjoy the <em>me</em> time for a part of the day, every day, was what I wanted, I think.</p>
                    <p><em>Hope is what keeps us going; with a smile.</em></p>
                    <p>I moved to Europe and went over my budget to have a balcony that wasn’t shared, received sunlight and faced the street. Wohooo! But wait, something was missing, it didn’t fit in my dream; completely.
                      The balcony was on the first floor, I felt carried away in the bustle of life. My ideal balcony should be facing the street but should be high enough where I could see birds flying by and have a look at the minuscule world around me.</p>
                    <p><em>There is power in height. There is freeness in open spaces. There is love in nature.</em></p>
                    <p><em>There is happiness in a balcony.</em></p>
                    <div class="post-date">Do feel free to share!</div>
