Daylight hours work differently in Berlin. In winters, the sun sets by 4:30 P.M. and in summers, the sun sets by 10:30 P.M.  I was enjoying the usual three meals a day in winters in Berlin as well, but I started skipping dinner as the summer arrived. I just didn’t feel hungry at the usual dinner time even when I had an empty stomach for 9 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you know that you’re hungry?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An empty stomach signals the brain when you’re hungry, but that’s not all. The body is just a slave of the mind. By reinforcement, the subconscious mind has learned that dinner is associated with night and night is associated with no sunlight. The function of your subconscious mind is to store data and retrieve it on call of the conscious mind but unconsciously. So when there is sunlight the subconscious mind looks into its database and sends the corresponding &lt;em&gt;not dinner time&lt;/em&gt; message to the conscious mind that suppresses signals from the empty stomach which in turn decreases the activity of the hunger-causing nerve cells and increases the activity of hunger-inhibiting cells.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . . and that’s where the discrimination starts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Subconscious mind learns through reinforcement, gathering data day and night without applying logic. When watching or listening to something, we might think that it is for momentary pleasure, and we are conscious enough to not consume it, the subconscious mind has already stored the information. One can think of conscious mind as the &lt;em&gt;RAM&lt;/em&gt; and subconscious mind as the &lt;em&gt;storage&lt;/em&gt;, conscious mind’s memory/learning will be erased and it will eventually turn to subconscious mind’s storage which will define your actions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No one says or feels, &lt;em&gt;since she is a girl, let’s discriminate against her&lt;/em&gt;, but through years of reinforcement we have labelled things which &lt;em&gt;women are supposed to do&lt;/em&gt; and things which &lt;em&gt;men are supposed to do&lt;/em&gt; and that’s where the discrimination starts. If your dad says, “Let your sister stay and you pick up groceries in the night”, it’s his subconscious mind speaking through the conscious mind. This statement of his, upon reinforcement, will settle in your subconscious mind which your conscious mind can interpret in any possible way, one of them being &lt;em&gt;girls are not supposed to go out in the night&lt;/em&gt;, and some other guy may interpret it like &lt;em&gt;I will trouble her since she is out at night when she is not supposed to&lt;/em&gt;. Almost all the world’s discrimination problems are a result of the unconscious bias.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If we don’t reinforce things enough in our subconscious mind, our actions won’t change, our words or opinions may change.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to reinforce?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Through Senses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You might think that watching a film for pleasure won’t affect you, but the visuals and meaning &lt;em&gt;will settle&lt;/em&gt; in your subconscious mind and &lt;em&gt;will define&lt;/em&gt; your actions/choices later. By just watching, reading or listening to things repeatedly that you should and ignoring things that you should not can do the trick. In this world of social media and the internet, it might not be easy to do it, but it isn’t that difficult too.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Though the random switch to new activities won’t give you the same amount of pleasure, and you will tend to move back where you came from, for the switch to work you need to do &lt;em&gt;Dopamine Detox&lt;/em&gt; so that the activities that you have been doing till now don’t release Dopamine in your brain and in turn you don’t find pleasure in them and find pleasure in activities that might be boring initially but will give the right information to your senses and hence subconscious mind.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One of my friends quit Netflix, Social Media, Bollywood for two years and when she came back she was unable to find pleasure in them, all of it felt like trash to her. In those two years, because of reinforcement her subconscious mind unlearned information provided by these sources and learned to release dopamine and hence feel pleasure in activities namely reading, meditating, listening to positive affirmations etc.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I recently quit Instagram and Facebook and have realized the trash I was filling my mind with while scrolling. Even if you think a post that went by didn’t register in your mind since you chose to ignore it, your subconscious mind will register that information on seeing multiple instances of similar posts.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The power of the conscious mind is its ability to feed data in the subconscious mind so that when the conscious mind refers to the subconscious mind in the future there is useful information in it. The subconscious mind isn’t creative, it doesn’t understand jokes, and it can remember everything you have ever done, said or witnessed without your conscious mind realizing it. So even when you think you can consciously choose to watch/listen to/do things but not register them, it doesn’t happen that way.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Placebo effect is a typical example of the power of the subconscious and conscious mind.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why are memes toxic?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Let’s say there is a movie you know about which explicitly supports racism so you consciously chose to not watch the movie. Well done! You took the best decision for your subconscious mind.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But memes work differently, they present you with ideas funnily, so your conscious mind thinks that you are just scrolling memes for pleasure, and laughter of that moment but you will not consume that information, in the back, your subconscious mind will register that information which will lead to unconscious bias.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/meme.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The subconscious mind is dumb but has the ability to remember everything, your conscious mind cannot remember everything but can logically choose what data should be fed to your subconscious mind for referencing later.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Having said it is not possible to choose what you consume all the time but at least try to choose whenever and wherever possible. It’s not about a drop in the ocean but about filling an ocean drop by drop.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dopamine Detox can do the trick. Give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like how you care about what you feed your stomach, do care about what you feed your mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Vansika Pareek</name><email>vansikapareek2001@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Post" /><summary type="html">All my life I have had dinner by 7:30 in the evening, by this time the sun sets in summers and of course in winters as well in India (at least in my hometown).

Lately, I realized I am doing no good to myself and the people around me by not conveying this appreciation. We all have a story and we all are trying hard to move through life. One word of appreciation can move mountains for people without us realizing it. We, in general, are of the opinion that our words of kindness won’t help much. Also, we tend to appreciate strangers or acquaintances more than the people close to us thinking that the appreciation we hold for them is something obvious that won’t make a difference when explicitly stated. This false estimation of the impact of words can restrict people from saying things that might completely change someone else’s life for the better. Sometimes it’s not about false estimation, but shyness or hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The shyness/hesitation or false estimation can be overcome by a feedback loop. If you appreciate someone, the other person will feel happy about your words of kindness and realize the impact on them, so some other day they will not hesitate to convey their feeling of appreciation to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But for this to happen, &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; must understand how important it is to appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Appreciation shouldn’t be confused with validation. People don’t seek validation of others for things they are up to or for themselves, all they need is a motivation to see light in the dark. Human beings are wired like that. For example, a friend of yours having low confidence about the way their eyes look will see them differently in the mirror if you just go up to them and say, “Hey, your eyes look beautiful!”. I once received  a message from a friend of mine, which read, “Hey Vansika, you are doing great and I have a feeling that you will do wonders in your life!” This text just made my day. Your words of appreciation might pull out someone from total breakdown or suicide as well. That is the power of words. In this world of social media where it is easy to abuse people from behind the screen, we need words of appreciation more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The other day I had a call with my colleague in a “get to know fellow Amazonians session for freshers”, when I asked her about a challenge she faced in life, she talked about how she kept to herself her appreciation for others and realized its importance when her manager pushed her to do so. She now feels happy whenever she appreciates the people around her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sometimes all we need is a push&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There isn’t a special day, a special time or a special place for you to appreciate others, just do it right here and right now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Vansika Pareek</name><email>vansikapareek2001@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Post" /><summary type="html">I often appreciate people inside, but have a hard time telling them right on their face things I absolutely love about them.

        &lt;p&gt;The lockdown has proved that humans are indeed social animals. Working from home is something I want to get rid of, I spend most of the weekdays staring at the screen or walls. Therefore, I make sure to travel every weekend. This weekend I went to Potsdam, a city on the border of Berlin, with Prakhar and Abhishek.  This was my second trip to Potsdam; I have covered most of Berlin and the lockdown ain’t allowing me to cross the borders of the city so I am revisiting places though Potsdam is worth it!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Potsdam is a small city which can be covered on foot in a day. Its main attraction is the Sanssouci Palace which is in the Sanssouci Park. I am fond of the park because of its symmetry. A tiny dome emerges from the trees on the parkway which is the Sanssouci Palace. The parkway from the main entrance to the palace is lined with trees and diverging roads leading to beautiful structures related to the palace. It takes at least 4-5 hours to walk to and explore (from the outside, the palace and other buildings were closed due to Covid restrictions) all the structures in the park. This Sunday wasn’t the best time to visit Potsdam; we were drenched in winter rain, but it is a must visit in Summers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/travel/potsdam/light-and-dark.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We spent most of our time taking pictures from Abhishek’s Pixel 4A 5G and Prakhar’s iPhone 11 and comparing, we soon realised that the iPhone captured better photos when it was dull (with little to no sunlight) adding in more hue whereas Pixel was able to capture the bright light of the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are frequent 40 min direct trains from Berlin Central Station to Potsdam which makes it fairly easy to reach Potsdam from Berlin but don’t forget to wear masks on metro stations, we forgot to wear masks after having lunch on the metro station and were stopped by a policeman, he came in between our way and smiled at us till we put on our masks. Cute!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The beauty of Sanssouci Park will surely make me visit Potsdam once again but this time in Summers.&lt;/p&gt;

Note the word &lt;em&gt;private&lt;/em&gt;, I prefer not to share a balcony just like I prefer not to share my &lt;em&gt;books&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The houses we had been living in till I graduated from high school were without a balcony, we weren’t able to find a house with one, so the university hostels were my only escape then. To my bad luck, my family shifted to a new house with a balcony a few months after I entered university. Though I was happy to stretch my arms on a balcony, even if for a few days when I went home during the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Apparently, hostel rooms for the first-year students didn’t have a balcony, so I made peace with the thought that I will have one in my second year of university. The hostel room in my second year did have a balcony, but it received no sunlight throughout the year. A balcony without sunlight for me is no balcony at all. So I patiently waited for the third year of college, every year was hope for me because every year we had the chance to shift to a new room.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;My room in the third year of university had a balcony that received sunlight for a few hours,  but it was shared. Phew! A shared balcony with sunlight; half of my dream was fulfilled. However, I was okay, I had one more year left of college, final year rooms were not shared and all of them had a balcony. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, all these years I used to sit in the hostel verandah and look up at the sun with eyes closed to feel the warmth, something we secretly crave for all our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The balcony in my room in the final year of university was all mine with sunlight, but it didn’t have a view, it faced the hostel courtyard where I could just see security guards for most of the day! Three-quarters of my dream were fulfilled. Not so bad!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A private balcony facing the street where I could sip coffee whilst reading a book, feel the gentleness of the breeze and protection of the sunlight, see life passing by on the streets in haste while I sit to savour it and enjoy the &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; time for a part of the day, every day, was what I wanted, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hope is what keeps us going; with a smile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I moved to Europe and went over my budget to have a balcony that wasn’t shared, received sunlight and faced the street. Wohooo! But wait, something was missing, it didn’t fit in my dream; completely.
        The balcony was on the first floor, I felt carried away in the bustle of life. My ideal balcony should be facing the street but should be high enough where I could see birds flying by and have a look at the minuscule world around me.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is power in height. There is freeness in open spaces. There is love in nature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is happiness in a balcony.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Vansika Pareek</name><email>vansikapareek2001@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Post" /><summary type="html">Living in a house with a private balcony has always been my dream.
