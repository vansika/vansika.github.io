                    <p>The lockdown has proved that humans are indeed social animals. Working from home is something I want to get rid of, I spend most of the weekdays staring at the screen or walls. Therefore, I make sure to travel every weekend. This weekend I went to Potsdam, a city on the border of Berlin, with Prakhar and Abhishek.  This was my second trip to Potsdam; I have covered most of Berlin and the lockdown ain’t allowing me to cross the borders of the city so I am revisiting places though Potsdam is worth it!</p>
                    <p>Potsdam is a small city which can be covered on foot in a day. Its main attraction is the Sanssouci Palace which is in the Sanssouci Park. I am fond of the park because of its symmetry. A tiny dome emerges from the trees on the parkway which is the Sanssouci Palace. The parkway from the main entrance to the palace is lined with trees and diverging roads leading to beautiful structures related to the palace. It takes at least 4-5 hours to walk to and explore (from the outside, the palace and other buildings were closed due to Covid restrictions) all the structures in the park. This Sunday wasn’t the best time to visit Potsdam; we were drenched in winter rain, but it is a must visit in Summers.</p>

                    <p>We spent most of our time taking pictures from Abhishek’s Pixel 4A 5G and Prakhar’s iPhone 11 and comparing, we soon realised that the iPhone captured better photos when it was dull (with little to no sunlight) adding in more hue whereas Pixel was able to capture the bright light of the sun.</p>
                    <p>There are frequent 40 min direct trains from Berlin Central Station to Potsdam which makes it fairly easy to reach Potsdam from Berlin but don’t forget to wear masks on metro stations, we forgot to wear masks after having lunch on the metro station and were stopped by a policeman, he came in between our way and smiled at us till we put on our masks. Cute!</p>
                    <p>The beauty of Sanssouci Park will surely make me visit Potsdam once again but this time in Summers.</p>
